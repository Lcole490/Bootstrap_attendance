# Bootstrap_attendance


This is a repo created to practice simple bootstrap integration. The following was done as part of the practice

- Create a new repository on Github, clone it to your computer and then add an index.html and a style.css file. 
  
- Add the necessary links and script tags for bootstrap. 
  
- Create a bootstrap grid layout that has 3 columns. Remember that columns go in rows and rows go in container.
  
- Put a bootstrap card into each column and make sure they are evenly spaced across the page. Give each card an image. You can use this website for help on the images https://placeholder.com/

- Add some sort of custom styling in your css file and make sure it works. (Added hover effect to buttons)
  
- Deploy your page.
